# Postfix

Postfix is a Java class that contains a stack-based postfix calculator in main(). It utilizes the StackNode class, a modified version of Node, as its basic data unit and Stack, a data type that stores a collection of elements in a linear, ordered sequence in which only the root element or the "top" of the stack can be accessed. Using Stacks containing StackNodes to keep track of operators and operands, the postfix calculator evaluates String expressions in which operands come before their operators (reverse polish notation). This project also features a testDriver that reads in a variety of test cases from a text file and checks their validity with another text file.
